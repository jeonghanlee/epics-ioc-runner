# Work Register

Release line: 1.4.2
Milestone index: 1.4.2
Canonical path: `docs/milestone-1.4.2.md`
Canonical branch or ref: `release-1.4.2`
Git upstream: none; local branch opened from `master` at `1bb270f45192763eb9db799bbf8a9b97901c803f`
Remote tracker: `jeonghanlee/epics-ioc-runner`; GitHub milestone `1.4.2` does not yet exist; issue #157 is assigned to `Backlog` (9)

Next session entry point: Review and accept the remaining durable-test work in M1's Implementation Plan and Test Plan, then add real detach-key checks to the lifecycle suites. The nc removal and production-validation documentation are implemented in the current working tree.

The implementation baseline is commit `1bb270f45192763eb9db799bbf8a9b97901c803f`:
`con` and `socat` use Ctrl-A by default, `--detach-key` selects a key per
connection, and `nc` is excluded from `attach`. The same commit updates the
console documentation and resolves the runner and completion ShellCheck
diagnostics. The development version is `1.4.2-dev`; that version change is
still uncommitted when this plan is created.

This register tracks the remaining durable verification and documentation
work. It does not treat the existing implementation as completed acceptance
evidence. The released 1.4.1 record remains in `docs/milestone-1.4.1.md`.

## Milestone

### Work

| Group | ID | Work unit | Type | Status | Ready | Deps | Done when / Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Console | M1 | Verify console detach keys and align documentation (#157) | Milestone | In progress | No | D1, D2, D3, D4 | Real con/socat default and custom-key cases pass; nc exclusion for attach/monitor, input handling, banners, and guides agree; socat production validation limits are explicit; [detail](#m1---verify-console-detach-keys-and-align-documentation) |

### Decisions

| ID | Decision | Decision Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Continue the implemented console changes on `release-1.4.2`, opened from the updated master, using development version `1.4.2-dev`. | 2026-09-22 |
| D2 | Keep Ctrl-A as the default for both con and socat, and retain the per-connection `--detach-key` option. Verify both clients with their default and custom keys. | 2026-09-22 |
| D3 | Exclude nc from both attach and monitor. Use con or socat only; fail with an installation hint when neither suitable client is available. Monitor requires con with -r or socat. | 2026-09-22 |
| D4 | Prefer con for production console access. Support socat for ordinary use while explicitly documenting that production workloads with sustained heavy or burst IOC output have not been validated. Production load testing is outside this change. | 2026-09-22 |

### Milestone Details

#### M1 - Verify console detach keys and align documentation

Origin: 1.4.2 / M1
Identity History: none
GitHub Issue: #157, https://github.com/jeonghanlee/epics-ioc-runner/issues/157
Status: In progress

##### Summary

Establish repeatable acceptance evidence for the implemented detach behavior
and make every console instruction agree with the observed client behavior.
The current `test_console_attach` functions in the local and system lifecycle
suites inspect socket permissions, con availability, and socket listening
state; they do not send a detach key through `ioc-runner attach`.

##### Scope

- Exercise the shipped runner, real con or socat, real procServ, and a real IOC
  through a PTY in the local and system lifecycle suites. Respect the suite's
  selected source or installed runner.
- Cover four required combinations: con/default Ctrl-A, socat/default Ctrl-A,
  con/custom key, and socat/custom key. Use `ctrl-]` as the documented custom
  example and also `ctrl-b` to cover a key outside procServ's ignore list.
- Verify the selected client and key in the banner, client exit, terminal
  restoration, IOC continuity, socket continuity, and reconnectability.
- Verify that the detach key is consumed by the client; distinguish this from
  procServ discarding Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, and Ctrl-]. Include the default Ctrl-A
  line-editing limitation in the documentation.
- Remove nc from all runner console selection and execution paths. Verify
  nc-only rejection for attach and monitor, including con without -r when
  socat is unavailable. Retain monitor's read-only behavior and exit keys.
- Verify CLI option validation and completion.
- Document socat's unverified production behavior under sustained heavy and
  burst IOC output; ordinary-use support is not production load evidence.
- Review and update `README.md`, `docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md`,
  `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/USER_GUIDE_LOCAL.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  CLI help, and attach banners where needed against the executed cases.
  Preserve already-correct text.
- Maintain the affected test catalogs, `tests/reporting-counts.csv`, and test
  documentation under `tests/REPORTING_CONTRACT.md`.

Out of scope: changing the default key, adding an nc path, changing monitor's
read-only behavior or exit keys, persistent per-user key configuration,
scrollback support, unrelated ShellCheck cleanup, production load testing,
release publication, and production deployment.

##### Completion Criteria

- All four required client/key combinations have separate, passing checks in
  shipped tests, with the actual runner and client identities recorded.
- Each successful detach ends only the client. The original procServ PID and
  IOC child PID remain alive, the unit remains active, the original socket
  remains available, and a fresh attachment can execute an IOC shell command.
- The terminal settings after detach match those captured before attachment.
- A custom-key connection does not change the default of the next connection.
  Under a custom key, Ctrl-A is available to the IOC line editor again.
- Ordinary IOC input reaches the IOC; the selected detach byte does not reach
  procServ. Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D remain ignored by procServ when neither is the
  selected detach key. Silence alone is not evidence of where a byte stopped.
- With no con or socat available, both attach and monitor reject an nc-only
  environment with the documented installation hint. Neither selects nc.
  Monitor also fails when con lacks -r and socat is unavailable.
- The guides list only con and socat as supported console clients, prefer con
  for production, and explicitly state that socat has not been validated for
  production workloads with sustained heavy or burst IOC output.
- Help, banners, examples, accepted key syntax, and input explanations agree
  with the real test results. Direct `con -c` examples retain default Ctrl-A.
- Required checks do not report success on missing prerequisites, timeouts,
  or forced cleanup. Catalog and result records account for every case.

##### Dependencies And Decisions

- D1-D4 define the release line, key behavior, supported console clients, and
  production validation limits.
- The implementation baseline is `1bb270f45192763eb9db799bbf8a9b97901c803f`;
  these changes are already present and are not a request to reimplement them.
- Documentation verification uses the executed banner and input results.
- The live #157 body still excludes configurable keys and nc changes. D2-D3
  extend that older scope; the canonical plan is the source for a later issue
  update and reassignment to 1.4.2. No GitHub mutation is authorized by this plan.

##### Implementation Plan

Plan Status: draft
Plan Acceptance: none
Implementation Authorization: 2026-09-22 for nc removal from attach/monitor and the production-validation documentation; 2026-09-23 for the accepted con read-only option detection fix. The remaining durable test implementation is not yet authorized.
Superseded Plan Artifacts: none

1. Add a shared PTY test helper under `tests/lib/` and real detach checks to
   `tests/test-local-lifecycle.bash` and `tests/test-system-lifecycle.bash`.
   Wait for an observed ready IOC connection before sending each key; capture
   exit status, terminal attributes, procServ/IOC PIDs, unit state, socket
   identity, and a command result after reconnection.
2. Select the real client through an isolated outer filesystem/PATH boundary.
   The socat case must make the runner's fixed con search paths unavailable,
   not merely change PATH. Do not replace `do_attach`, `resolve_con_tool`,
   procServ, or the IOC with an internal mock or a reconstructed implementation.
3. Add CLI rejection and completion cases to `tests/test-error-handling.bash`.
   Cover missing and invalid values, reserved Ctrl-T, a non-attach command,
   case-insensitive names, and the documented backslash quoting.
4. Update the console documentation and test guide from the observed results,
   including nc exclusion from attach and monitor, socat's production validation
   limit, and the difference between client-consumed and procServ-ignored keys.
   Remove monitor's nc fallback and fail when neither con with -r nor socat
   is available. Preserve existing monitor exit keys. Perform a second-person
   read of all changed guidance.
5. Register every added check before execution and reconcile the affected
   catalog counts. If the release suite matrix's identity hash changes,
   follow `gate/RUNBOOK.md`'s check-identity repin procedure; never invent the
   new hash or copy it from a failing run.
6. Run the checks below and record their actual environments and evidence.
   Resolve any confirmed defect within this scope before acceptance.

##### Test Plan

For T1-T4, invoke `ioc-runner attach` in a PTY against the suite's real
procServ/IOC fixture. Required observations are the named client and key,
successful client exit without external termination, restored terminal state,
unchanged live procServ/IOC PIDs, active unit, retained socket, and successful
IOC command execution after reconnecting. A timeout is a failure followed by
cleanup, not a successful detach.

| Label | Layer | Method | Environment | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | lifecycle-behavior | Attach through real con without `--detach-key`; send Ctrl-A | Local and system suites; selected source/installed runner | Common detach observations pass with default Ctrl-A |
| T2 | lifecycle-behavior | Make con unavailable, attach through real socat without `--detach-key`; send Ctrl-A | Same fixture and runner origins as T1 | Common detach observations pass with default Ctrl-A |
| T3 | lifecycle-behavior | Attach through con with `--detach-key ctrl-]` and separately `--detach-key ctrl-b`; send each selected key | Same fixture and runner origins as T1 | Both custom keys satisfy the common detach observations |
| T4 | lifecycle-behavior | Repeat T3 through socat selected by the real fallback path | Same fixture and runner origins as T2 | Both custom keys satisfy the common detach observations |
| T5 | lifecycle-behavior | Trace actual client-to-procServ and procServ-to-IOC bytes while sending ordinary input and control keys; verify Ctrl-A line editing under a custom key and reconnect without the option | Real PTY, client, procServ, and IOC; trace only the actual transport boundary | Selected detach byte stops at the client; ignored bytes stop at procServ; ordinary input and restored Ctrl-A editing work; next default is Ctrl-A |
| T6 | client selection and error-contract | Invoke shipped attach and monitor with only real nc visible and with no clients; also monitor with real con lacking -r, with and without socat, using executable paths both containing and excluding -r | Isolated executable search paths; real procServ/IOC for successful monitor connections | No nc selection; suitable installation hint when no supported client is available; old con selects socat regardless of executable path |
| T7 | error-contract | Execute shipped CLI with valid and invalid option forms; source the shipped completion handler | Error-handling suite | Accepted names and quoting work; invalid/reserved/missing/non-attach values fail before connection; completion offers the option and keys |
| T8 | documentation | Follow every changed attach example and compare help, banner, and guide claims with T1-T7; inspect direct-con examples and monitor wording separately | Source docs and corresponding executed output | Default/custom keys, con/socat-only selection, monitor exit keys, ignored input, IOC continuity, and socat's unverified production load behavior are explained consistently |
| T9 | lifecycle-behavior | Run T2's real-path scenario against the pre-fix runner from commit `48b7ed9` with identical client and IOC fixtures | Isolated historical runner fixture; bounded wait and cleanup | Ctrl-A fails to detach the old socat path, while T2 passes on the candidate; proves the regression detects the original defect |
| T10 | regression and reporting | Run Bash syntax checks, ShellCheck, the full error suite, affected lifecycle suites, and reporting validation | Supported suite environments under `tests/README.md` | Required checks pass with complete catalogs and consistent counts; no internal mocks stand in for the detach path |

##### Verification Results

Targeted checks on 2026-09-22 against the working tree based on `1bb270f`:

- `bash tests/test-error-handling.bash`: 199 assertions passed, with no
  failures, skips, not-applicable results, or script errors.
- `bash -n bin/ioc-runner`, plain ShellCheck, and its warning gate passed.
- The shipped runner rejected both attach and monitor in isolated nc-only
  and no-client environments, returning exit 1 and the installation hint.
- Against real procServ and softIoc 7.0.10 in a temporary local user service,
  real con and socat monitor sessions received console output and exited with
  their documented keys. Terminal settings were restored, and the original
  procServ PID, IOC PID, active unit, and socket remained available.
- Real con from before read-only support (`8e2ec7f^` in the con repository)
  selected socat when available. Without socat, monitor returned exit 1 and an
  installation hint despite nc being available. The IOC remained running.

These targeted checks are not production load tests or release Gate evidence.
The retained local monitor procedure is
`/tmp/ioc-nc-removal-9to66vbb/verify_monitor.py`; its adjacent logs and
`/tmp/ioc-nc-removal-errors.log` are temporary execution evidence.

Targeted follow-up on 2026-09-23: monitor detects the read-only option only
on a help option-definition line. With the same real procServ/softIoc fixture,
six cases passed: current con, direct socat, and old con with and without
socat at each of two executable paths (one containing `-r`, one without it).
Successful sessions detached with the documented key and restored terminal
settings; all cases preserved the original procServ/IOC PIDs, active unit,
and socket. Before the fix, the old con path containing `-r` produced
`Invalid switch "r"` even with socat available; that case now selects socat.
Bash syntax, both ShellCheck commands, and the full error suite passed
(199 assertions, no failures or skips). The local reproduction procedure
and logs are under `/tmp/iocmonitorfixknrhhb0z`; the error-suite log is
`/tmp/ioc-monitor-option-fix-errors.log`. These are targeted checks, not
completed shipped regression coverage or production load evidence.

These are planned checks for the shipped regression tests. Existing code,
earlier exploratory runs, and an open or closed issue do not fill these rows.

##### Closure Evidence

None. Implementation baseline: `1bb270f45192763eb9db799bbf8a9b97901c803f`.
M1 remains open until its verification and documentation criteria are met and
linked-issue closure is handled under the milestone closure procedure.
